    today we did:
        fixed the login message size,
        added wait to login close before mainUI launches
        added a facade that holds mainUI
        created country object
        createds list of country object, filled with json
        redid mainui
        resized country dropdown
        country dropdown holds country data
        -note;should we have a list of start yearsfrom 1962- to now, or should the start year list start at the start year of the country object relative to the name


        -for next time:
            implement start year system, on click listener to find the start yuear of country from the drop down selection
            implement end year system, on click listener to find the end year of country from the drop down selection
            how to add all the selected data from the lists to a userselection object, (onclick listener potentially?)
            -states? potential: statre of chose country, can pick start year, if country is njot selected they cannot choose start year etc
            -let david know whats happening
             see whats next on the list

    completed today:
        -Event listeners have been added to all buttons
        -Clicking on recalculate will print out all the set
            data from the user selection object
        -Error messages are displayed for invalid data selection
        *(First 5 Countries on list currently not allowed for fetching)
        -Clicking recalculate without filling in all fields properly will give error message
    
    still needs to be done:
        -Modular way of adding analysis types to GUI analysis list
        *Analsis types should be stand alone classes
        -Using user selection object data to fetch data and perform analysis
        -Using result object from analysis to create viewers before adding them to GUI

    completed today:
        - Refactored event listeners so that all events are handled in the mainUI facade
        - Created external country exclusion file for system to cross check which countries are allowed for fetching
            this included the AllowFetch class that parses the json file
        - User selection object now takes in the users selected countries 3 digit iso instead of the full name
        - Implemented analysis clesses (following strategy design) that call a fully functional data fetcher
        - Implemented analysis factory class for dynamically instantiating the necessary analysis class
        - Implemented result object that stores data returned from analysis classes after computation
